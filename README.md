# hAns
(**h**TTP **Ans**ible). The missing Ansible HTTP API to run existing playbooks against one or multiple hosts. It 
also comes with a simple web dashboard to show some metrics.

**Be careful!** hAns is under heavy development and is not stable yet

## Why?
Because ansible was desgined in a push mode flavour! This a simple way to trigger a 
playbook execution remotely without having neither SSH access to any machines or access to 
a playbooks repository (git, svn...).

## Ok, but...when may I use this?
I think there are two perfect scenarios:

1. auto-provision machines at boot time without worrying about installing Ansible, clonning repositories and so
2. trigger a playbook execution from our CI system

## Install
Soon!

## Use it
Soon!
